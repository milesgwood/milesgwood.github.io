This page is for tips and tricks within Dreamweaver.

## Shortcuts

`F12`  - opens up the browser live preview
`CNTRL + E` - Quick edit the stylesheet from within the HTML  

I was really hopeful for the quick edit function for sass. Unfortunately quick edit only lets you edit the compiled css and not the sass. That sucks.

# Live Preview alternative

You can use a node server instead of the dreamweaver one. That way the markup is cleaner.

```
npm --version
6.10.0
npm install http-server -g
http-server /mnt/w/milesgreatwood.com
```

# Format Code

Go to `Edit > Code > Apply Source Formatting` or use the hotkey you set in `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts`.

Apply Source Formatting: `Ctrl + /`
Apply Source Formatting to Selection: `Ctrl + Shift + /`

# Setup

I'm installing Lightroom Classic 9.2 through the creative cloud downloader. This version allows you to leave the CC subscription eventually. The CC version requires you to have a current subscription since it is web based.

## Preferences

Under Performance - set Camera Raw Cache location to `I:\Lightroom\CameraRawCache`

## Catalog Settings

Location of the catalog is in `C:\Users\miles\Pictures\Lightroom\Miles`

## Import Workflow

So you select `Move` for a bunch of photos that exist on the Images drive already. That way you are slowly processing them.

Add them in batches, making sure to add them to a descriptive collection.

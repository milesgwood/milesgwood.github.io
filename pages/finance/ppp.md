# Take in the PPP loan correctly in quickbooks - liability

Created the PPP account and gained an understanding of `Other Expenses` vs. ordinary expenses on a Profit and Loss sheet. [JJ the CPA youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y5woSialVU)

1. Setup new account called PPP as an `Other Current Liability`
2. Import the transaction through bank feeds and set the account to PPP (ignore the payee)

This will make the PPP loan show up on the Balance Sheet (Reports > Company... > Balance sheet) instead of the Profit and Loss section.

You don't want you ordinary income to be adjusted by PPP. It's not income. It is a relief fund of money.

# What to do in quickbooks when the loan is forgiven

At the end of the year you want to go into the Chart of Accounts and click on the PPP loan to make a journal entry. Then you want to decrease the liability as it was forgiven. Create a new account called `Coronavirus Relief Fund` and decrease the liability by the full amount (assuming if was forgiven)

Get PPP forgiven and [decrease the liability in QB with a journal entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eTJBceecuM) - [PPP Quickbooks Tutorial](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/banking/how-do-i-enter-the-ppp-loan-into-my-deposit/00/542685) - `When loan is forgiven`

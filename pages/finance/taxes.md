# 1040

This is a personal tax return due March 15th. You filed it through `turbotax online` in 2018 and they won't let you download the full return without paying.

# Property Tax

For Charlottesville I'm required to list all business property and pay tax on it. I need to create a way to describe this in Quickbooks. This includes computers, desk furniture, all office supplies etc. It does NOT include software and consumable items like paper products etc.

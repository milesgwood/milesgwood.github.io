# Why am I an S-corp

S corps are pass through entities. A pass-through entity is a special business structure that is used to reduce the effects of double taxation. Pass-through entities `don't pay income taxes at the corporate level`. Instead, corporate income is allocated among the owners, and income taxes are only levied at the individual owners' level.

So you pay yourself a salary and then you take the extra income left over and distribute it to the shareholders as a distribution. The distribution is `not` subject to Social Security (12.4%) half of which is paid by the S-Corp and also Medicare (2.9%), again half of which is paid by s-corp.

 S corp. profit distributions are not subject to FICA taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare taxes.

 My main confusion revolves around what happens to the extra $5000 that my business made outside of my salary. Where does that income go on the tax forms and at what rate is it taxed? Is it taxed as income or capital gains? I know I don't have to pay the Employer side of FICA taxes on it since it isn't wage income. What tax do I have to pay on it?

 From reddit the extra money is a distribution that I don't have to pay any self employment tax on. That means no employer or employee FICA/SS/Medicare tax which equates to 15.3% currently. That is the tax savings. That's why you have a s-corp.

The additional money gets taxed as ordinary income!!!

```
The character of the income will flow through to the individual. i.e., if the income was derived from capital gains at the S-Corp level, then it would be taxed as capital gains on the individual level. If it was ordinary income, then it would pass-through as ordinary income to the individual. Also, some other deductions pass through in this same manner. (e.g. charitable contributions)

In some states there are also some tax levied at the entity level. Here in CA, there is a 1.5% tax on S-Corp profits (Min of $800 tax).

[Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cspVK9429DcN_pkbJ7Ml--_MS66LGWs-k9d6zIPWtdk/edit#gid=0)

Payroll taxes pay half of your FICA and withhold some of your Federal Income Tax. As you cas see in the sheet I am taking out all of the employee portion of the taxes. In 2019 that's 583.54 of a 3k paycheck. That's why I get paid 2416.16.

I need to figure out what percent Federal Income Tax and State Income Tax I should be paying. All of the numbers in the spreadsheet add up except for the Income Tax numbers.

For federal income tax I calculated on a 36000 salary I owe $4126 or 0.1146111111%.

With `5716.09` additional income from the business for the year that increases my income slightly. Calculations are in the sheet but the total federal income tax owed by me is `$5036.14`. I have already paid  `$4,125.60` to the IRS through my payroll service which is exactly how much I'm supposed to be paying were it not for the dividend income.

What May Happen
----

With just salary I owe - `$4125.60` -- That's what was paid!
With salary and distribution - `$5036.13`
With salary dividend treated as income and 12k standard deduction - `$3371.93` - refund `753.66`
With all above and QBI deduction - `$3234.74` - refund 890.8544

I may also be able to take a `Qualified Business Income` deduction which accounts for 20% of the profits for my company. That amounts to a deduction of `$1143.21` which isn't really that much.

Predictions
Federal Tax - I've paid  `$4,125.60` in FIT this year through my payroll service. Considering the extra income from the business and the standard deduction I calculate I only needed to pay `$3371.93`. So I think I'm owed `753.67`.

# Terminology

Gross Income - All the money you receive
Net Income - Gross minus Expenses

Adjusted gross income and taxable income
Your adjusted gross income (AGI) is a modified version of the total income you receive from all sources, such as wages, salaries, dividends and capital gains. To calculate your AGI, you're allowed to subtract various adjustments from your total income, including IRA contributions, alimony, moving costs and certain business expenses. AGI is important, because it can affect things like how much you can claim for your itemized deductions, says Arthur Mendoza, M.B.A. and Principal of Hermosa Beach, CA-based Copia Solutions. Most states also base taxation amounts on your AGI, rather than your total income.

At the end of the day, Mendoza says, "taxable income is the most relevant number on your tax return." That's because the amount of tax you owe is based on your taxable income, as opposed to any other figure. "Deductions, adjustments, anything that can lower your adjusted gross income ultimately trickles down to your taxable income," Mendoza says. This can mean lower taxes or a bigger refund.

Standard deduction or itemized deductions
"Proper use of deductions is an important way taxpayers can lower the amount they owe," according to Mendoza. The two main types of deductions are itemized deductions and the standard deduction. The standard deduction is the same for all taxpayers and is set by the IRS. The amount varies depending on your filing status, and it is also regularly adjusted for inflation. You subtract your standard deduction directly from your adjusted gross income.

If you do not wish to use the standard deduction, you can claim itemized deductions. Doing so takes additional time, but that extra effort can result in big tax savings, especially if you have big deductions like mortgage interest. If the total amount of your itemized deductions exceeds the standard deduction, you're usually better off itemizing. Common itemized deductions include the following:

mortgage interest
medical expenses
charitable contributions
casualty losses
state, local and property taxes
For tax years prior to 2018, the IRS allows you to lower your AGI even further through the use of exemptions. "Exemptions work just like deductions, but they represent a different type of expense," says Mendoza. You're granted one exemption for every member of your household. This includes yourself, your spouse, and any dependents, such as younger children or any family member who relies on you for support. Unlike deductions, the value of each exemption is the same regardless of your filing status. As with the standard deduction, the amount you can deduct for each exemption can vary from year to year.

Beginning in 2018, exemptions are no longer used in calculating your tax able income. Instead, there is a dependent credit and expanded child tax credit to help lower your tax bill.

Credits
Mendoza notes that tax credits are often even more effective than deductions at lowering your taxes. “Credits are a dollar-for-dollar offset to the amount of tax you owe," he says, "rather than a reduction of your taxable income."

For example, if you owe $1,000 in taxes but qualify for a $600 tax credit, the tax you owe drops to $400. If that $600 was a deduction, you might save as little as $60, because it just reduces the amount of your income that can be taxed. Some credits, such as the earned income credit, are "refundable," meaning if the credit is larger than the total tax you owe, you receive a refund from the government.

Filing status
Your filing status determines which tax brackets apply to your return. Filing status options are:

single
head of household
married filing jointly
married filing separately
qualifying widow(er) with qualifying child
You can only select a status that applies to your situation, although in some cases you may have multiple options. For example, if you are married, you can choose to file separately or jointly, although Mendoza states that "in most cases, filing jointly offers the best tax option for married couples."

Withholding
Withholding is the process by which you pay your taxes directly to the IRS as you earn your income. Your employer can set up your paycheck so that a certain amount of tax is withheld every period. If you don't make withholding payments, the IRS might assess a penalty when you file your tax return, since the U.S. uses a "pay-as-you-go" method.

If you over-withhold your taxes, you'll likely end up with a refund. Tempting as it may be to over-withhold and get a large refund, Mendoza says that's not a financially sound policy. "If the IRS is writing you a check every year, you've been extending the government an interest-free loan. Instead of having the IRS hold your money all year," Mendoza says, "at the very least, you could keep that money in a savings or investment account and earn interest on it. At the end of the tax year, you could withdraw that money—with interest—and have the 'rush' of getting an even bigger 'refund' check."

This is a personal tax return due March 15th. You filed it through `turbotax online` in 2018 and they won't let you download the full return without paying.

# Property Tax

For Charlottesville I'm required to list all business property and pay tax on it. I need to create a way to describe this in Quickbooks. This includes computers, desk furniture, all office supplies etc. It does NOT include software and consumable items like paper products etc.

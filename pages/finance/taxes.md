# City Business License

- No new property to report
- 2019 Gross sales 59596

I paid a 50$ check to Cville for having a business over 5k in income.

# Why am I an S-corp

S corps are pass through entities. A pass-through entity is a special business structure that is used to reduce the effects of double taxation. Pass-through entities `don't pay income taxes at the corporate level`. Instead, corporate income is allocated among the owners, and income taxes are only levied at the individual owners' level.

So you pay yourself a salary and then you take the extra income left over and distribute it to the shareholders as a distribution. The distribution is `not` subject to Social Security (12.4%) half of which is paid by the S-Corp and also Medicare (2.9%), again half of which is paid by s-corp.

 S corp. profit distributions are not subject to FICA taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare taxes.

 My main confusion revolves around what happens to the extra $5000 that my business made outside of my salary. Where does that income go on the tax forms and at what rate is it taxed? Is it taxed as income or capital gains? I know I don't have to pay the Employer side of FICA taxes on it since it isn't wage income. What tax do I have to pay on it?

 From reddit the extra money is a distribution that I don't have to pay any self employment tax on. That means no employer or employee FICA/SS/Medicare tax which equates to 15.3% currently. That is the tax savings. That's why you have a s-corp.

The additional money gets taxed as ordinary income!!!

From Reddit
```
The character of the income will flow through to the individual. i.e., if the income was derived from capital gains at the S-Corp level, then it would be taxed as capital gains on the individual level. If it was ordinary income, then it would pass-through as ordinary income to the individual. Also, some other deductions pass through in this same manner. (e.g. charitable contributions)

In some states there are also some tax levied at the entity level. Here in CA, there is a 1.5% tax on S-Corp profits (Min of $800 tax).

[Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cspVK9429DcN_pkbJ7Ml--_MS66LGWs-k9d6zIPWtdk/edit#gid=0)

Payroll taxes pay half of your FICA and withhold some of your Federal Income Tax. As you cas see in the sheet I am taking out all of the employee portion of the taxes. In 2019 that's 583.54 of a 3k paycheck. That's why I get paid 2416.16.

I need to figure out what percent Federal Income Tax and State Income Tax I should be paying. All of the numbers in the spreadsheet add up except for the Income Tax numbers.

For federal income tax I calculated on a 36000 salary I owe $4126 or 0.1146111111%.

With `5716.09` additional income from the business for the year that increases my income slightly. Calculations are in the sheet but the total federal income tax owed by me is `$5036.14`. I have already paid  `$4,125.60` to the IRS through my payroll service which is exactly how much I'm supposed to be paying were it not for the extra income.

What May Happen
----

With just salary I owe - `$4125.60` -- That's what was paid!
With salary and distribution - `$5036.13`
With salary dividend treated as income and 12k standard deduction - `$3371.93` - refund `753.66`
With all above and QBI deduction - `$3234.74` - refund 890.8544

W-2 income, amounts received as reasonable compensation from an S corporation, amounts received as guaranteed payments from a partnership, and payments received by a partner for services under section 707(a) are also not QBI.

I may also be able to take a `Qualified Business Income` deduction which accounts for 20% of the profits for my company. This is the money on line 1 of the k-1 or $2,338.



Predictions
Federal Tax - I've paid  `$4,125.60` in FIT this year through my payroll service. Considering the extra income from the business and the standard deduction I calculate I only needed to pay `$3371.93`. So I think I'm owed `753.67`.

# Terminology

Gross Income or Total Income - All the money you receive
Net Income or AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)- Gross minus Expenses
Taxable Income - AGI less deductions and exemptions
Credits - add money back after you calculate what you owe

# 1040

This is a personal tax return due March 15th. You filed it through `turbotax online` in 2018 and they won't let you download the full return without paying.

# Property Tax

For Charlottesville I'm required to list all business property and pay tax on it. I need to create a way to describe this in Quickbooks. This includes computers, desk furniture, all office supplies etc. It does NOT include software and consumable items like paper products etc.

# 2020 Taxes

You download your W-2 through the payroll for free app. Go to Tax Forms and load the 2019 W-2 for all employees.

I'm going to use Credit Karma this year to file my 1040.

In 2019 I only purchased BTC so there are no taxes to pay. I didn't sell or convert any coins.

The ordinary pass through income on line 1 of the k-1 gets logged as income from property and appears under the home header in CK.

As part of the QBI deduction I get 20% of the pass through profits as a deduction. 20% of 2338 is 468. This 468 appears under self-employment.

Paid extra `$339` to federal gov for bank bonuses and pass through income subject to FIT. Also paid VA `$101`.

Completed June 10th 2020, one month earlier than needed to since covid pushed the due date to July.

# Terminology

Features - Datapoints or fields.
Lables - Outcomes or descriptions derived from datapoints.
Binning - Group elements together to create non-linear features. Example: (Age 21-40, Age 41-60)
Non-linear Features - features that take a distribution that isn't linear. Polynomial, log features.
Web Page Feature Examples - URL, in/out anchor text, title, frames, body, presence of images or tables, styles, size, boldness, positioning.

# Parameter Tuning - turning knobs on machine

Loss Function
 - Sqare: regression classification
 - Hinge:
 - Logistic:

Regularization - prevent overfitting by making weights small

Learning Parameters
- Decay rate too fast - never reaches a good answer
- Decay rate too slow - algoritim is indecisive and bounces around

# CRISP-DM

Cross Industry Standard Process - Data mining
